        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Bubble Buddies! Fun with sums. Always free. The slides are made by a Grade 8 student. I started the project because I found it difficult to self-study—resources were scattered and confusing.</p>
        <p>Each slideshow is thoughtfully created using Canva and focuses on core math topics that students often find tricky or confusing. Every slide is designed with clear explanations, step-by-step walkthroughs, and simple animations to make learning visual and easy to follow.</p>
        <p>What makes Bubble Buddies special is that it’s built by a student, for students—so the content actually makes sense from a kid’s point of view. You don’t need a teacher, tutor, or parent to guide you—just click, explore, and learn at your own pace.</p>
        <p>Whether you’re reviewing a topic or learning it for the first time, these slides are made with care to help you feel confident, not overwhelmed, because learning math should be friendly, fun, and totally within your reach!</p>

        <h2>Why I Started Bubble Buddies</h2>
        <p>I still remember when I was younger; I used to sit at my desk, staring at math problems and wishing someone could explain them in a way that made sense. A lot of websites felt too serious or made me feel like I wasn't smart enough.</p>
        <p>That's why I created Bubble Buddies. I wanted to make something simple, friendly, and fun—something I wish I had back then. Now, I hope it helps other kids feel less alone and a lot more confident with math.</p>
